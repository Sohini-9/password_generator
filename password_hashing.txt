What is hashing?
Hashing means chopping something into small pieces to make it look like a confused mess.
Hashing in cryptography: Converting data of variable size into a fixed size using a function called as hash function.
Hashing is different from encryption, encrypted data can be decryupted backs.

Property of hash function:
It is easy to generate the hash but impossible to re-generate original input from a given hash.


Adding salt:
Just as we add salt to our food, we add salt to our passwords before hashing them.
Salt is nothing but a random string which is appended or prepended to our password.
This newly created string is then passed to our hashing function.
This gnerates a hash function which is almost impossible to trace back as hacker/attacker can guess the initial password but cannot guess the salt addeed to its.
